# Tweets Denoising for Health Domains

### Project Overview
This project presents a novel approach to denoising tweets, particularly in health-related contexts, using **Enhanced Differential Evolution (EDE)**. By optimizing tweet content through domain-specific NLP techniques, the system improves relevance and coherence while filtering noise and irrelevant information. The application targets improving health communication, specifically in the context of topics like cholera outbreaks, public health education, and sanitation campaigns.

### Key Features
- **Domain-Specific Relevance**: Uses health-specific keywords to evaluate and enhance the contextual importance of tweets.
- **Tweet Denoising**: Filters noise such as mentions, hashtags, URLs, and irrelevant words.
- **Differential Evolution Optimization**: Implements a robust population-based optimization technique to refine tweet content.
- **Visualization and Insights**: Provides analytical charts and word clouds to showcase the denoising effectiveness and tweet content trends.

### Tools and Technologies
#### Programming and Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing denoising results.
- **WordCloud**: To generate word cloud visualizations.
- **Re (Regular Expressions)**: For text preprocessing.
- **Unicodedata**: For text normalization.

#### Algorithms and Techniques
- **Differential Evolution (DE)**: For iterative optimization of tweet relevance.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, removal of stop words, and text normalization.
- **Fitness Function**: Evaluates tweets based on domain-specific relevance and penalizes irrelevant content.

#### Data Sources
- **CSV Files**: Used for loading raw tweets dataset.
- **Custom Keyword Dictionary**: Health-related keywords for evaluating relevance (e.g., cholera, epidemic, hygiene).

### Methodology
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Tweets are loaded from a CSV file.
   - Preprocessing removes invalid or irrelevant entries.

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Removes noise (e.g., URLs, mentions, hashtags).
   - Normalizes text and converts it to lowercase.
   - Filters out common stop words and non-health-related words.

3. **Differential Evolution Optimization**:
   - Generates an initial population of denoised tweet sets.
   - Mutates and recombines tweet populations iteratively.
   - Selects the best candidates based on a fitness function measuring domain relevance.

4. **Visualization**:
   - **Histograms and Box Plots**: Analyze domain relevance distribution.
   - **Word Cloud**: Displays frequent terms in denoised tweets.
   - **Scatter Plot**: Compares original and denoised tweet lengths.

5. **Results**:
   - Outputs the most relevant tweets with enhanced readability and contextual relevance.
   - Saves a CSV file of denoised tweets with corresponding domain relevance scores.
